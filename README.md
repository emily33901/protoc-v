# protoc-v

This is the compiler code for [vproto](https://github.com/emily33901/vproto).

vproto can parse most (or maybe all...) of the proto2 spec. It compiles the [Steam Protobufs](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/Protobufs) generating valid code and also parses the `protoc` plugin protobufs (which can be found in `plugin/google/protobuf`). It can parse options, extensions, map fields and extends definitions but does not generate relevent code for it.
